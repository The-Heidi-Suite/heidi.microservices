## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you discover a security vulnerability within HEIDI microservices, please send an email to:

**[INSERT SECURITY EMAIL]**

### What to Include

Please include the following information:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity within 5 business days
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed about our progress toward a fix
- **Fix**: We will work to fix critical vulnerabilities as quickly as possible
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline

### Security Best Practices

When deploying HEIDI microservices in production, please ensure:

#### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Changed all default secrets (JWT_SECRET, JWT_REFRESH_SECRET)
- [ ] Using strong, unique passwords for all services
- [ ] Implemented proper RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- [ ] Enabled MFA where applicable

#### Infrastructure
- [ ] All services running behind HTTPS/TLS
- [ ] Secrets stored in secure vault (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- [ ] Regular security patches applied to all dependencies
- [ ] Database encrypted at rest and in transit
- [ ] Redis password protected
- [ ] RabbitMQ secured with proper credentials

#### Network Security
- [ ] Firewall rules configured to restrict access
- [ ] Services not directly exposed to the internet
- [ ] Using API Gateway or Load Balancer
- [ ] DDoS protection enabled (Cloudflare, AWS Shield)
- [ ] Rate limiting configured on all endpoints

#### Application Security
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] SQL injection protection (Prisma ORM handles this)
- [ ] XSS protection headers enabled (Helmet middleware)
- [ ] CSRF protection implemented where needed
- [ ] File upload validation and sanitization
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information

#### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Security event logging enabled
- [ ] Audit logs for authentication and authorization
- [ ] Anomaly detection configured
- [ ] Regular security log reviews
- [ ] Alerting on suspicious activities

#### Data Protection
- [ ] PII (Personally Identifiable Information) encrypted
- [ ] Regular database backups with encryption
- [ ] Data retention policies implemented
- [ ] GDPR/compliance requirements met
- [ ] Secure data deletion procedures

#### Dependencies
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Automated vulnerability scanning (Snyk, Dependabot)
- [ ] No known vulnerabilities in production dependencies
- [ ] Using specific versions (not `latest` or wildcards)

### Known Security Considerations

#### JWT Token Management
- Access tokens expire in 15 minutes (configurable)
- Refresh tokens expire in 7 days (configurable)
- Tokens stored in Redis with TTL
- Consider implementing token rotation for enhanced security

#### Password Security
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- Minimum password length: 6 characters (increase in production)
- Consider implementing password complexity requirements
- Consider implementing password history

#### Session Management
- Sessions stored in Redis
- Session hijacking protection via token fingerprinting (to be implemented)
- Consider implementing IP-based session validation

#### Rate Limiting
- Default: 100 requests per minute per IP
- Configured via ThrottlerModule
- Adjust based on your traffic patterns

#### CORS Configuration
- Default: Allow all origins in development
- **Production**: Configure specific allowed origins
- Set appropriate headers for credentials

### Security Maintenance

We recommend:

1. **Weekly**: Review security logs and alerts
2. **Monthly**: Update dependencies and patch vulnerabilities
3. **Quarterly**: Conduct security audits and penetration testing
4. **Annually**: Review and update security policies

### Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to fix the vulnerability before public disclosure
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and data destruction
- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it
- Do not access or modify other users' data

### Recognition

We appreciate the security research community's efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. Security researchers who report valid vulnerabilities will be:

- Acknowledged in our security advisories (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)
- Listed in our SECURITY_HALL_OF_FAME.md file
- Given credit in the CHANGELOG.md for their contribution

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and will be clearly marked in the CHANGELOG.md with a **[SECURITY]** tag.

## Contact

For any security-related questions or concerns:
- Email: [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL]
- Do not use public channels (GitHub Issues, Discord, etc.) for security issues
